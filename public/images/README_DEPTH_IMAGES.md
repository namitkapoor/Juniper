# Depth Effect Images Setup

Please save the following images to this directory:

1. **Self photo.png** - The color photograph (the one with the purple turtleneck)
2. **Self photo depth map.png** - The grayscale depth map

## Image Requirements:
- Both images should be the same dimensions
- The depth map should be grayscale where:
  - **White** = closest to camera (foreground)
  - **Black** = furthest from camera (background)
  - **Gray** = middle distance

## Current Status:
⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Save the images you provided to this folder with the exact names above.

The DepthHeroImage component is configured to use these images from:
- `/images/Self photo.png`
- `/images/Self photo depth map.png`
